Before we get started. We have to agree on few rules.

1. The code gets executed only if it was called inside the main method.
2. You can add as many lines as you want.
3. The code gets executed from top to bottom.
4. In programming, we use a lot of brackets. Each bracket has different meaning.

   ​ a. `( )` those are called parentheses.

   ​ b. `{ }` those are called curly brackets or curly braces.

   ​ c. `[ ]` those are called square brackets.

   ​ d. `< >` those are called angle brackets. `<` this alone also mean less than. and `>` this alone mean greater than.

   5. ` ;` this is called semicolon.
   6. Every dart line should end with a semicolon. (except when there are curly braces)
   7. A syntax error is a incorrectly written line of code that doesn't follow the rules. For example, forgetting to add a semicolon by the end of a line is a syntax error.
   8. A code will not execute if it has a syntax error.
   9. If a code has a syntax error, the output window will try to give you hints to solve that error. Always look at those hints.
   10. Any text in programming is represented between quotation marks. `"like this"`.

       > For example, if you want to print hello, you can't use `print(hello);`, but you use `print("hello");`

And finally, throughout this journey, we're going to tackle the main points that programming code do. Which is explained in this diagram.

1. We store values using the concept of variables and constants (`var`, `final`, `int`, `double`, …)
2. We store actions using the concept of methods / functions (`void`,...)
3. We perform instructions using function call or performing an equation (`toString()`, `1+2`)
4. We control the flow of executions using conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`…), and loops (`for`, `while`, …)
