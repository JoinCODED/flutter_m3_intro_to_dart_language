# Variables

Let's starting writing our first dart code. We want to make an app that keeps track of number of pizza slices in our fridge 🍕. 



1. Define a variable called **pizza**.
2. Assign value of 6 to it. Let's say we have 6 slices of **pizza**. 

```dart
void main() {
  var pizza = 6;
}
```



That's it. Now if we run the app. Nothing happens. Let's try to use the command `print`, in order to print it to the Console window. 

> PS: We're not going to print a physical paper 🖨️.

Now a very hungry guy came to the fridge and took all the pizza 😋.

 1. Change **pizza** value to 0 

 2. Print that statement. 

 3. Print the new **pizza** value

> **Note**:  we don't write `var pizza = 0;` We only use `var` if we want to create a **new** variable. pizza is an old variable, and what we wanted to do is to modify pizza's value to a new value. 

If you like math, and you see this 

```dart
pizza = 6;
pizza = 0;
```

You might be wondering now… how pizza can equal to 6, and equal to 0!

The thing is, this is not an equal sign, this is an **assignment** sign. when we say `pizza = 6`, we assign a value of 6 to pizza. And we modify it `pizza = 0`, we assign it a new value. So it's like, from now on, consider pizza to be 0;
