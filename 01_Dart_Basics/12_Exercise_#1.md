# Exercise ( #1 )

Try to guess what's the result for the following:

```dart
double x = 4;
x+=9;
print(x);
x-=5;
print(x);
x*=4;
print(x);
x/=2;
print(x);
```





### ++ , --  

We can go even shorter, but only for incrementing and decrementing by 1 step. 

```dart
counter += 1;
counter -= 1;
```

Those two can be shortened to 

```dart
counter++;
counter--;
```
