# main method

Once you open the dartpad, you're gonna see this code, now we're going to understand piece by piece. The first thing we'rer going to do understand is **main**. 

1. To understand **main**, let's delete the code, and only type `print("Hello");` You're going to see an error, and the code won't run. Because `main` is the entry of our code. Every single dart application should have one main method as its entry point. No main no gain!

2. Let's tap `Reset` button. Now let's run the code, it's working!



3. Now if we change `main` to `main2`, note what's going to happen. The application is going to complain. Read the red error message.

4. You can't run a dart application without a main method that is called literally `main`. 

Now to start coding, we're going to write our codes inside the main method. after the first curly-bracket, and before the last one. As shown in the following figure. </br>
