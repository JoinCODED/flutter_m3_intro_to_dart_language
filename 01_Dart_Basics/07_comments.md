# **Comments**

Sometimes you want to explain something while you write the code, like adding a sticky note or something.



Sometimes, us, as instructors, we explain the code using comments. Comments are texts added to your code that doesn't affect the code.

Note that comments take another color. You can add a single line comment by adding a `//` at the beginning of the line. 



```dart
// this is a single line comment
This is a syntax error, you can't type comments without slash slash!!
```



Note that `//` will only make this line a comment. to write multiple line comments, we can use 

```dart
/*
 multiple
line 
of
comments

It starts with a slash star, then ends with a star slash

*/ 
```



You can use comments to disable a line of code.

`a = 4` will not be executed because it's commented out. 





Btw, don't overuse comments by explaining every single thing. For example:-
