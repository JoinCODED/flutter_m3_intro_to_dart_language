# Data types



In the pizza example, let's try changing the pizza value to **"No Pizza"** instead of 0.

What happened! Look at the red line under "No Pizza". It's indicating that the error is at this part of the code. Let's look at the console. 

> Error: A value of type 'String' can't be assigned to a variable of type '**int**'.What is String? What is **int**? What's going on! ðŸ˜¢

If you click on the word `pizza`, and looked at the documentation that dartpad.dev offers at the bottom right corner. You will see `int pizza`. And `int` is a short of `integer`, which is the type of this variable.

So basically, in dart language, when you define a variable, that variable has to have 2 main things. 

 	1. Name 
 	2. Type



And once a variable is assigned to a specific type, you can't assign a value to it from another type.

For instant, our variable pizza was assigned to a value of 6. 6 is an integer. That's why it was stored in the computer as an integer. Now if you try to assign it a value that's not an integer. For example, 2.5, it's not going to be allowed!





### The 4 most common data types

### Why there are data types?

You know what is this right? It's a closet! ðŸ‘•

Give yourself a moment to look at the image. What do you notice? ðŸ¤”

You notice that the big items are placed together like jackets. Small items are together like hats ðŸ‘’. 

Okie dokie, so what does that have to do with data types?, you might ask ðŸ˜†.

Each data type has a different size. For example, an integer has less details than double, since the distance between 1 to 2 for int is just a single step. But double can have 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.3001, etcâ€¦ That's why they have different sizes. And different sizes should be stored in different places in the computer memory.
