Remembr when we mentioned that the computer stores values, and actions? Well, here we are, we knew how to let the computer store values using variables. But what about actions? When you teach a kid how to brush his teeth, you give them steps, and they have to memorize it.

1. Get the toothpaste
2. Open it
3. Put some toothpaste on the brush
4. Close the toothpaste
5. Rub your teeth with the brush for 1 minute
6. wash the brush with water

So this is a procedure that has to be done daily. You won't be instructing your kid with those commands on a daily basis, they have to know it. But they don't hold clear values like 4 or 8. They are actions. And that's what functions are. 



An official definition of functions would be: 

> **Functions** are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. **Functions** usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a **function** is written, it can be used over and over and over again. **Functions** can be "called" from the inside of other **functions**.
