# void

If you go to dart pad and read the first word. It's void main. That's actually a function. `main` is a function that gets called when the app starts. It's the starting point. Inside the function, you can code everything. And we can create smaller functions and we call them inside main. Let's create our first function that prints out our name.

Now we have done 2 steps 

1. creating the function
2. calling the function





Let's talk about them in details

1. When you create a function you have to 
   1. specify the type of the function. For our example, it's void. 
   2. give the function a unique name. For our example, it's printMyName
   3. open and close the parenthesis after the name. This what makes a function a function. 
   4. Open curly brackets, and write what the function does inside them
2. When you call the function you have 
   1. Make sure the function is defined in the scope of the file, or it's imported (we're going to talk about importing later on)
   2. type the function name 
   3. Open parentheses and close them
