# **if else statements**

Have you ever wondered how does the mobile screen work? How does it decide to let you in if you type the password correctly, or it blocks if you don't?Let's figure out!





### **Example**

1. Define a String constant called password, give it a value of some secret password.
2. Define a String variable called myAttempt, which represents the user attempt when they try unlocking the phone.
3. if password equals to myAttempt then print("You have unlocked the phone!")
4. else, print("You have typed a wrong password!")

### **If statement**

The if statement, take inside parentheses the condition. And the condition is a simply a question. The answer of that question should be either true or false. So if the answer is trye, the statements block will be executed. If not, then the statement block will be ignored. In the first case, `password` was matching `myAttempt`. That's why the statement inside the curly brackets of the if statement was executed. In the second attempt, when we changed myAttempt, the statement inside the if block didn't execute.



### **else statement** 

Else statement comes after an if statement. I can't come alone! the else statement's block will only be executed if the if statement condition failed. Note that we don't add a condition to the else statement. the condition of the else statement is automatically calculated by negating the if condition.
