# **Boolean expressions**

If you have tried to write the if statement as follows and it didn't work for you.

```dart
  final password = "secret";
  var myAttempt = "secre";
  
  if(password = myAttempt){
    print("You have unlocked the phone! âœ…");
  }
```

Then good job! You discovered our secret. We didn't talk in the previous step about the `==` thing, but now it's time. 

an if statement as mentioned takes a condition. What's a condition? It's a bool value.

And you know that bool takes only `true` and `false`. And we can get those 2 values using what we call logical expressions. Here is a list of the available relational operators you can use.

So simply, to compare 2 values, you can choose on the operations up here.
