# Exercise ( #2 )

Try to guess what will be printed, and what not

```dart
void main() {
  var a = 4;
  var b = 10;
  
  if(a == b){
    print("a is equal to b");
  }
  if(a != b){
    print("a doesn't equal to b");
  }
  if(a > b){
    print("a is greater than b");
  }
  if(a >= b){
    print("a is greater than or equal to b");
  }
  if(a < b){
    print("a is less than b");
  }
  if(a <= b){
    print("a is less than or equal to b");
  }
}
```
